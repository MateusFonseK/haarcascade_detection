# Face Detection using Haar Cascade

Code for detecting faces, eyes, cars, clocks, and full bodies using Haar Cascade Classifiers with OpenCV. This repository demonstrates how to leverage pre-trained classifiers for object detection in images.

## What is Haar Cascade?
Haar Cascade is a machine learning-based approach for object detection proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones. It:
- Utilizes features resembling Haar wavelets.
- Employs a cascade of classifiers trained to detect objects efficiently.
- Works well for structured and predictable object shapes, such as faces.

### Advantages:
- Fast and efficient for real-time applications.
- Lightweight and easy to use.
- No need for extensive computing resources.

## Features
- **Face Detection**: Detects faces in images.
- **Eye Detection**: Identifies eyes within face regions.
- **Car, Clock, and Body Detection**: Recognizes these objects using different Haar classifiers.
- **Preprocessing**: Resize, grayscale conversion, and parameter tuning.
- **Parameter Adjustments**: Includes `scaleFactor`, `minNeighbors`, and `minSize` for optimizing detection.
